This data visualization project aims to provide an interactive timeline in svg format of the most relevant digital currencies since 1990. Current functionality includes links and contextual information discovered when hovering mouse over elements.

CHANGELOG:

1.0 - 18/03/2012
First full, completed version. Includes basic interactivity: opacity of year's column changes when mouse hovers over them. If there's contextual information for that year, it also shows/hides it depending of mouse activity.

0.5 - 10/03/2012
First version published. Includes the timeline, with all the data, no interactivity. Informational text is illegible. Each currency title is a link as well.

TO DO

- Include contextual information in currencies' timeline area: Name, type of currency, cause of disappearance.
- Add interactivity to that contextual information via tooltip script: onmouseover/out shows/hides the information.
